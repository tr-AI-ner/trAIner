When documenting your code, please make sure to follow the following GUIDELINES

++++++++++++++ Format of a Doc Comment ++++++++++++++++
A doc comment is written in HTML and MUST precede a CLASS, FIELD, CONSTRUCTOR or METHOD_DECLARATION. 
It is made up of two parts -- a description followed by block tags. 

GUIDELINES:
    - So lines won't wrap, limit any doc-comment lines to 80 characters.
    - The first line contains the begin-comment delimiter (/**)
    - Each line above is indented to align with the code below the comment.
    - Write the first sentence as a short summary of the method, as Javadoc automatically places it in the method summary table (and index).
    - If you have more than one paragraph in the doc comment, separate the paragraphs with a <p> paragraph tag (as shown in example below)
    - Insert a blank comment line between the description and the list of tags (as shown in example below)
    - The first line that begins with an "@" character ends the description. 
      There is only one description block per doc comment; you cannot continue the description following block tags.
    - End of comment ends with end-comment delimiter (*/) in a new line


In this example, the block tags are @param, @return, and @see.

        /**
         * Returns an Image object that can then be painted on the screen. 
         * The url argument must specify an absolute {@link URL}. The name
         * argument is a specifier that is relative to the url argument. 
         * <p>
         * This method always returns immediately, whether or not the 
         * image exists. When this applet attempts to draw the image on
         * the screen, the data will be loaded. The graphics primitives 
         * that draw the image will incrementally paint on the screen. 
         *
         * @param  url  an absolute URL giving the base location of the image
         * @param  name the location of the image, relative to the url argument
         * @return      the image at the specified URL
         * @see         Image
         */
         public Image getImage(URL url, String name) {
                try {
                    return getImage(new URL(url, name));
                } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
                    return null;
                }
         }

(Notice the inline tag {@link URL}, which converts to an HTML hyperlink pointing to the documentation for the URL class. 
This inline tag can be used anywhere that a comment can be written, such as in the text following block tags.)

Afterwards you can run the Javadoc tool to see a visual generated representation of your comments
