# trAIner
The immersive java game where you can train your own AI to perform seriously challenging levels!



# Workflow:
Cheat sheet for using github successfully:)

1. Pick a feature you want to implement.
2. Create a new branch for the feature you will implement:
```git checkout -b <branch-name-or-feature-name>```
3. Code the task
4. When ready you have to commit your work.
```git add .```
```git commit -m "Your commit message or comments"```

4a. (optional). If someone else is also working on the same be sure to pull latest work
```git pull```

5. When ready push your changes so everyone can see them
```git push origin <your-branch>```

6. Go to github.com, select your branch and open a pull request. Invite at least one person to review your code. If the code is production you can't merge it yourself!


Train and test your own AI on the trAIner battlefield and compete with other players in the trAIner-Arena!

# Coding Style:
1. Use 4 spaces to indent tabs
2. Naming convention:

    2.1 Class names always begin with a uppercase character, the rest is written in CamelCase
    
    2.2 Package names always begin with a lowercase character, the rest is written in underscore_case
    
    2.3 Function names always begin with a lowercase character, the rest is written in CamelCase
    
    2.4 Variable names always begin with a lowercase character, the rest is either in CamelCase or in underscore_case
    
    2.5 Constants are written in all uppercase combined with UNDERSCORE_CASE
    
3. Documentation

    3.1 Each class needs a brief description of its functionality right after the exports
    
    3.2 Each function needs a brief description of its functionality just before its definition
    
    3.3 Each non self explanatory variable needs a brief description before its declaration
    
    3.4 KEEP DOCUMENTATION MINIMAL, FOCUS ON SELF EXPLAINING CODE
